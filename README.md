## RETAIL TIME SERIES ANALYTICAL SUMMARY
### TIMES SERIES ANALYSIS

#### OVERVIEW
This analysis provided insights into the sales performance of a retail store for 2011 fiscal year, revealing seasonal trends all year round and identifying revenue patterns. By analyzing various parameters based on the data received, I provided recommendations on idles times for promotion and restocking, and as well answered the question which is whether there were any cyclical behaviors observed in the sales.

#### DATA SOURCE
The primary source of data used for this work is the csv file shared to us in the “Queen_Arit_datachallenge” via Nas.io.

#### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the initial phase, I performed the following processes:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing data in cells by removing all duplicates in the dataset, splitting date and time column
These were done to ensure the integrity and quality of the data were kept, with the rows being 536,641 rows in total.
- I also created some calculated columns to facilitate further analysis including:
- - Quarter of the year
- - Revenue generated

#### ANALYSIS TOOL
Microsoft Excel 2019

#### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
By employing the use of pivot tables and calculated columns, I was able to answer the following:
- What are the total revenue generated per month?
- What are the total revenue generated per annual quarter?
- What is Total sales of the year?
- What is the Annual revenue generated in the year 2011?
- Which country is the Highest selling point?
- What is the Peak sales period?
- In which month of the fiscal year was there a dip in generated revenue?

#### DATA ANALYSIS
Below are some DAX Expressions used during my analysis:





#### RESULTS AND INSIGHTS
The top 5 products based on the analysis of the Amazon sales data set in terms of the average rating by customers and reviews combined are all products under ‘**Electronics**’ Category of products
- Total sales: £4.82 million
- Annual revenue generated: £8.39 million
- Highest selling point: United Kingdom
- Peak sales period: The highest revenue period was in November: £1.46 million followed by October. Shockingly there was a dip in December in the generated revenue – £0.43 million which could be as a result of reduced working days, office closures and holidays.
##### Any Cyclical Behaviours?
Yes. Seasons come and go within the year. Many made purchases in September, October, and November in Preparation for Christmas but little in December because of the seasons holiday. By January, many working people reduce spending in order to recover from the previous months spending
##### Restocking?
Seeing the dip in December, and considering new product models that are usually out in new year – January. Restocking therefore, could be done twice a year: In December; wholesalers want to sell off at this time hence we can buy at cheaper rate leveraging at a lower price. This won’t be our full restocking. In February; Since new models would be out in this time, the main restocking should be done at this time.
##### Promotions?
Strategic Promotions should be in the 3rd quarter of the year so that our customers could have time to fit in our products in their budgets, and compare options before the sales surge which is expected in the last quarter of the year.
